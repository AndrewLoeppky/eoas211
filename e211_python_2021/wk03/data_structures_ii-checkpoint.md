This week is diffucult to map MATLAB --> Python. the old matlab worksheet is a combination of logical indexing, OO programming (Their 'Data Structure' would be a Class in python), but it would make more sense at this stage to reinforce concepts like data types, or introduce dictionaries as a way to store data/metadata (or jump all the way in to pandas and/or xarray?)
