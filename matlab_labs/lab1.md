# Lab 1

## Overview

The purpose of the first lab is to get you comfortable with the way MATLAB works and to show you (by example) how to do a number of useful things.

Nothing will be graded this week, but you must submit the item(s) noted in Section 10. Future labs will assume you
are familiar with the material here. If you have computer experience some of this may seem trivial but this will not
necessarily be the case later on.

## Pair Programming

During labs you will be working in pairs using a technique called PAIR PROGRAMMING. It works like this:

1. You pair up with someone else
2. One person (the “driver”) sits in front of the computer and types. The other (the “navigator”) watches what is
going on and makes comments.
3. Every 15 minutes, you SWITCH roles (we will announce the switchover time).
4. You are EACH responsible for handing in your own lab (you may or may not have identical labs). You MUST
add a comment to the code with the name of your partner.
5. If you have not completed the lab at the end of the lab period (which is usually the case), you are free to a)
schedule more pair-progamming time with your partner, or b) complete the lab by yourself.

## Goals

* Familiarize yourself with the MATLAB interface and using it on a PC (or your own laptop)
  
  1. logging on!
  2. learn how to make a folder (directory) and work IN THAT folder (directory) in MATLAB

* Learn (by example) how to do a number of useful things within MATLAB, specifically how to:

  1. load and save data
  2. initialize and use variables
  3. make x-y plots of data: playing with colour, symbols, parts of your data set
  4. edit, save and run a basic MATLAB script
  5. comment your code

By the end of the lab you should be comfortable with the following MATLAB operations:

* load, save, ```=```, inputting / saving data and variables
* plot: making simple plots
* ```whos```, ```clear```, ```clf```, ```close```: listing & clearing variables in the workspace, clearing and closing figures
* help: MATLAB help!
